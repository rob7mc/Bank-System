<h3>Login Details:</h3>
Login details are provided below. There are 2 users in the BOD_USERS database, both of whose credentials seen 
below can be used to log in (login.jsp) and interact with the banking website. Two users were created for the purpose
of showing how the current user logged in can only view their details and account transactions, despite the
databases holding multiple account details and transactions.

User 1:
Username: username
Password: password
		
User 2:
Username: smurph
Password: mypass

<h3>General Operation:</h3>
<h4>Login</h4>
The login.jsp page links to the loginServlet.java servlet to do user validation by comparing the username and password
passed in to the BOD_USERS database and get the session parameters, where it links verified users to the accountInfo.jsp.
This page is the users account information page which displays their name, account number, email and branch and also lets
them view their accounts, transfer money between these accounts, pay a bill or search for an ATM location.
The Accounts.java class is used to provide getter and setters for the arraylist in the accountInfoServlet.java servlet.

<h4>Account Information & Navigation (Previous Transactions, Transfers, Bill Payment)</h4>
From here the user has many options where they can go to the currentAccount.jsp which links to the 
accountInfoServlet.java servlet to retrieve the current user's current account transactions or to the 
savingsAccount.jsp which links to the accountInfoServlet.java servlet to retrieve the current user's savings account 
transactions. They can also navigate to transfers.jsp to perform transfers between their accounts, through a redirect 
in the accountInfoServlet.java servlet or to billPayment.jsp to pay a bill from either of their accounts, again through 
a redirect in the accountInfoServlet.java servlet. They can also search locations to find ATMs where ajax is used to 
allow in page replacement of locations found without the need to refresh the accountInfo.jsp (Bonus Feature). It uses 
ajax in accountInfo.jsp, javascript in ajax_javascript.js, the ajax_javascriptServlet.java servlet and the BOD_ATMS 
database to perform this.

<h4>Transfer Between Accounts</h4>
When the user has navigated to transfers.jsp, a form must be completed to get the account they want to transfer
from to the account that they would like to transfer to. It also contains the amount they would like to transfer
and a button to submit the form to the transfersServlet.java servlet. This servlet processes all the information
received from this form and current session parameters to update the BOD_CURRENT_ACCOUNT and BOD_SAVINGS_ACCOUNT
databases accordingly and then redirects the user back to accountInfo.jsp with a message to confirm the transfer has
taken place. The user cannot transfer between the same account, i.e. current account to current account and the 
current date is added to the database whenever a transfer is made between accounts where one account is debited and
the other account is credited. 

<h4>Pay A Bill</h4>
When the user has navigated to billPayment.jsp, a form must be completed to get the account they want to pay
from and the bill they would like to pay. It also contains the amount they would like to pay and a button to submit 
the form to the billPaymentServlet.java servlet. This servlet processes all the information received from this form 
and current session parameters to update the BOD_CURRENT_ACCOUNT or BOD_SAVINGS_ACCOUNT databases accordingly based on 
which one was selected and then redirects the user back to accountInfo.jsp with a message to confirm the payment has
taken place. The current date is added to the database when a payment is made and the account that was selected is debited.

<h4>Other Notes & Features</h4>
Note that when a transfer is made or a bill payment is made, the user is redirected to the account information page where 
the transactions can then be viewed in either the current account or the savings account. The transaction_id increases per
transaction between all users, i.e. if user 1 makes a transaction it is 1, then if user 2 makes a transaction it is 2, then 
if user 1 makes a transaction again it is 3. This means that each transaction has an unique id. Users are also not allowed
to make transactions if they have no money in their account.

The CSS for all jsps can be seen in login.css, AccountInfo.css and CurrentSavingsAccounts.css in the CSS folder. Any 
images used can be seen in the images folder.

<h3>Bonus Features:</h3>
- Ajax was implemented with javascript to allow the in page replacement of data being searched for

- Form validations are performed on the client side where "required" is used within input tags. This means that
  forms cannot be submitted until all of the relevant fields are completed. On top of this certain fields required
  specific input types, such as currency. This format was also specified in the input tags.
  
- Session tracking is also performed using HTTP session, where a user has a session created on login with their specific 
  details from the database. These details are then passed to all subsequent pages providing the session remains open.
  
- Each jsp has a logout button, when pressed goes to a relevant servlet to kill the current session and log the user out
  by returning them to the login.jsp. This is important to kill the session as session tracking is active before logging
  out. However, the browser cache still holds the session parameters and therefore if the user goes back a page, their
  information can still be seen.
  
- There is a timeout after 2 minutes of inactivity from a user, which redirects them back to the login page notifying 
  them that they have been logged out.

- The taglibs-standard-impl-1.2.5.jar and taglibs-standard-spec-1.2.5.jar jar files were imported in the lib folder in 
  WEB-INF to allow the use of the "c:forEach" loops in jsps. These are obtained from the oracle website.
