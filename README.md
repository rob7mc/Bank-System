# Bank-System

This project was the development of a bank system web application as part of a college assignment. 

The Eclipse IDE was used to develop the application using the Java programming language. Java Servlets, Java ServerPages (JSPs), CSS and JavaScript were used to build the application. Apache Tomcat was used as a server for the application. SQL was used for the creation of database tables in Oracle DB. The web application was deployed as a .war file.
